# [UNOFFICIAL] Oculus Headsets for SteamVR (OculusWRP)
It's time to replace your Oculus installations with OculusWRP, a new way to enjoy your Oculus headsets while using SteamVR, natively.

## Notice
This codebase is quite a mess, it was quickly put together and should not be indicative of the final product. You can see a [demo video from mid-August 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQzvabO6UQ) which shows OculusWRP working.

A compilation guide will be provided soonish, although if you're an experienced developer it should take little-to-no effort to compile this.
